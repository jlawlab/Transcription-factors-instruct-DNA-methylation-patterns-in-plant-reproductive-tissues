#This analysis reconstructs a phylogeny for 46 REM genes using two custom scripts:
#	LM_REM_phylogenetic_tree.bash — alignment and tree inference
#	LM_Phylo_Tree_Visualization.r — visualization


#REM phylogenetic tree step by step:
#	1. REM sequence alignment using MAFFT.

#	2. Phylogenetic tree construction using IQ-TREE2 with ultrafast bootstrap.

#	3. Tree visualization using the following R packages: ape, ggtree, and ggplot2.
