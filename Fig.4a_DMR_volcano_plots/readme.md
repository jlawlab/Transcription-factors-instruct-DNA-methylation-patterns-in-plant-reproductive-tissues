- Description: This code generates volcano plot of DMRs. DMRs that overlap HyperTE loci, siren loci, both, or neither are colored in blue, pink, purple, or black, respectively. The total number of hypo and hyper DMRs is indicated in black boxes in the center. The number of DMRs overlap with the above categories are shown in the correspondingly colored boxes. This is the base script used to generate DMR volcano plots for Figures 4a, 4b, and Extended Data Figures 4a.
- Example dataset: Data from Figure 4a.
