- Description: This code generates volcano plot showing the differentially expressed siRNA clusters in rim22. Clusters that are downregulated, unaffected, and upregulated are shown as blue, black, and red circles, respectively. The number of clusters in each category is indicated in the correspondingly colored boxes. Clusters overlap with methyl-cutting assay targets are highlighted. This is the base script used to generate volcano plots for Figures 1b, 1c, 2c, 3b, 3f, 6c, 7g, and Extended Data Figures 1g, 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 4a, 5b, 5d, 6f, 6g, 6j.
- Example dataset: Data from Figure 1b.
